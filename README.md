## 🔍 Detailed Analysis – SQL Queries

### 1️⃣ Top Paying Jobs
**Question:** What are the top-paying jobs for data analyst role?

📄 **SQL File:**  
[top paying jobs](/project_sql/1_top_paying_jobs.sql)

#### 🔎 What I did in this query?
- Identified the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst roles that are available Anywhere (remote).
- Focused only on job postings with specified salaries (excluding null salary values).
- Why? This highlights the top-paying opportunities for Data Analysts and provides insight into employment trends for high-compensation roles.

#### 💡 Key Insight
- Most high-paying roles cluster between **$180K–$250K**
- Highest-paying roles are offered by **tech, finance, and data-driven companies**
- Despite the generic title “Data Analyst,” salary levels indicate **senior or highly specialized roles**

**Insight:**  
> Remote data analyst positions can offer extremely competitive compensation, especially for experienced professionals with specialized skills.

### 🧾 SQL Query Used

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title_short,
    job_location,
    job_posted_date,
    salary_year_avg,
    name as company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg is NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2️⃣ Skills Required for Top Paying Jobs
**Question:** What skills are required for these top-paying Data Analyst role?

📄 **SQL File:**  
[top paying job skills](project_sql/2_top_paying_job_skills.sql)

📊 **CSV Output:**  
[Top skills Data Insight excel](project_queries/query_2.csv)

#### 🔎 What I did in this query?
- Used the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst jobs identified in the first query.
- Added the specific skills required for these roles.
- Why? This provides a detailed view of which skills are most in demand for high-paying Data Analyst positions, helping job seekers understand which skills to develop to align with top salaries.

#### 💡 Key Insight
- SQL is the most essential skill — it appears across almost all roles.

- Python (and Pandas) + R show that analysts are expected to do real data manipulation, not just reporting.

- Tableau highlights strong demand for data visualization and stakeholder communication.

- Snowflake & Azure indicate a clear shift toward cloud-based data analytics.

- Mentions of Bitbucket / Go suggest analyst roles are slowly blending with engineering workflows.

Bottom line:
> Modern data analysts are expected to combine database querying, programming, visualization, and basic cloud knowledge — the role is broader and more technical than in the past.

### 🧾 SQL Query Used

```sql
WITH top_10_jobs as(
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg is NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT top_10_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM top_10_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
    ON top_10_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
    ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY top_10_jobs.salary_year_avg DESC;

```

### 3️⃣ Most In-Demand Skills
**Question:** What are the most in-demand skills?

📄 **SQL File:**  
[top demanding skills](project_sql\3_top_demanded_skills.sql)

#### 🔎 What I did in this query?
- Joined job postings to inner join table similar to query 2
- Identifed the top 5 in-demand skills i.e. **skills with highest job count** for data analyst role.
- Focused on all job postings.
- Why? Retrieves the top 5 skills with the highest demand in the job market, providing insights into the most valuable skills for job seekers.


#### 💡 Key Insight
- **SQL** and **Excel** are by far the most in-demand skills, appearing in the majority of job postings
- **Python** ranks close behind, highlighting the growing need for automation and advanced analytics
- **Tableau** and **Power BI** confirm strong demand for data visualization skills

### 🧾 SQL Query Used

```sql
SELECT skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) as skill_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
    ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY skill_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 4️⃣ Top Paying Skills
**Question:** What skills are associated with the highest salaries for data analyst role?

📄 **SQL File:**  
[top paying skills](project_sql\4_top_paying_skills.sql)

#### 🔎 What I did in this query?
- Looked at the avg salary for each skill associated with data analyst position
- Focused on roles with specified salaries regardless of location
- Why? It reveals how different skills impavct the salary as it helps identifying the most finacially rewarding skills

#### 💡 Key Insight
- Highest-paying skills (PySpark, Bitbucket, Couchbase) are engineering- and infrastructure-heavy, not traditional analyst tools.

- Skills like PySpark, Databricks, Airflow, Kubernetes indicate that big data & data engineering overlap pays more.

- Python ecosystem skills (Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter, scikit-learn) still command strong salaries, showing analytics + ML capability is valued.

- DevOps & tooling skills (GitLab, Jenkins, Linux, Atlassian) boost pay, signaling demand for analysts who can work in production environments.

- Cloud & platform skills (GCP, Databricks) consistently sit above $120k, reinforcing cloud literacy as a salary driver.

- Classic analytics tools (PostgreSQL, MicroStrategy) pay well but less than hybrid/engineering skills.

Bottom line:
> The highest salaries go to data analysts who blend analytics with engineering, automation, and cloud skills, not those limited to reporting or dashboards.

### 🧾 SQL Query Used
```sql
SELECT skills,
    Round(Avg(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg),0) as avg_yearly_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
    ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY avg_yearly_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

    ROUND(Avg(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg),0) as avg_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL and job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' and 
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
